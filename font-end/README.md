# To Do App

Developed a dynamic and responsive to-do application using cutting-edge 
technologies to enhance user experience and streamline task management. 
The project was built with React, leveraging the efficient development environment provided by Vite. 
To manage the state of the application, I implemented a robust state management system using reducers.
